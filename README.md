Here you will find a modified version of the OWL software developed by Guy Coleman: https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator/tree/main

This version allows for weed detection in an onion field (using the GOG module). A trained model is included for this purpose, and it can be further refined. 
You will also find a program that allows you to connect to a Flask server on the Raspberry Pi from a web page on a PC or smartphone on the same network, enabling you to remotely modify the config.ini file.
Many thanks to Guy Coleman for the fantastic work he has done developing OWL.

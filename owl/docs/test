Welcome to the OpenWeedLocator (OWL) project, an opensource hardware and software
green-on-brown weed detector that uses entirely off-the-shelf componentry, very simple
green-detection algorithms and entirely 3D printable parts. OWL integrates weed detection
on a Raspberry Pi with a relay control board in a custom designed case so you can attach
any 12V solenoid, relay, lightbulb or device for low-cost, simple and opensource site-
specific weed control. Projects to date have seen OWL mounted on robots and vehicles for
spot spraying!
On the weed detection front, a range of algorithms have been provided, each with
advantages and disadvantages for your use case. They include ExG (excess green 2g - r - b,
developed by Woebbecke et al. 1995), a hue, saturation and value (HSV) threshold and a
combined ExG + HSV algorithm. These algorithms have all been tested in a wide range of
conditions. The article has now been published in Scientific Reports (open access).

OWL Use Cases

robotVehicle-mounted spot spraying
The first, and most clear use case for the OWL is for the site-specific application of herbicide
in fallow. As part of the development and testing of the unit, the OWL team designed and
assembled a 2 m spot spraying boom, using two OWLs to control four 12 V solenoids each.
The boom was mounted on the back of a ute/utility vehicle with the spray tank located in
the tray and powered by a 12V car battery. Indicator lights for each nozzle were used to
highlight more clearly when each solenoid had been activated for demonstration and
testing purposes.

A second system, identical to the first, was developed for the University of Sydney's
Digifarm robot, the Agerris Digital Farm Hand. The system is in frequent use for the site-
specific control of weeds in trial areas. It is powered by the 24V system on the robot, using a
24 - 12V DC/DC converter.Image data collection
An updated image sampling method was added on 14/07/2022, which allows whole-image,
cropped-to-bounding-box and square images saved on a set frequency. This means the
OWL can now be used for image data collection much more easily than before. Example
images for each method are provided below.

Hardware Assembly
All components listed above are relatively "plug and play" with minimal soldering or
complex electronics required. Follow these instructions carefully and triple check your
connections before powering anything on to avoid losing the magic smoke and potentially
a few hundred dollars. Never make changes to the wiring on the detection unit while it is
connected to 12V and always remain within the safe operating voltages of any component.
Complete guide to hardware assembly
Before starting, have a look at the complete wiring diagram below to see how everything
fits together. The LEDs, fuse and Bulgin connector are all mounted on the rear of the OWL
unit, rather than where they are located in the diagram. If you prefer not to use or can't
access a Bulgin connector, there is a separate 3D model design that uses cable glands
instead.Required tools
Wire strippers
Wire cutters
Soldering iron/solder
Step 1 - enclosure and mounts
Assembling the components for an OWL unit requires the enclosure and mounts as a
minimum. These can be 3D printed on your own printer or printed and delivered from one
of the many online stores that offer a 3D printing service. Alternatively, you could create
your own enclosure using a plastic electrical box and cutting holes in it, if that's easier. We'll
be assuming you have printed out the enclosure and associated parts for the rest of the
guide, but please share your finished designs however they turn out!
The first few steps don't require the enclosure so you can make a start right away, but while
you're working on getting that assembled, make sure you have the pieces printing, they'll
be used from Step 4. For a complete device, you'll need: 1 x base, 1 x cover, 1 x RPi mount,
1 x relay mount, 1 x regulator mount, 1 x camera mount and 1 x plug.
Step 2 - soldering
There are only a few components that need soldering, including the fuse and voltage
regulator:
Soldering of voltage regulator pinsSoldering of 12V input wires to voltage regulator pins
Soldering of 5V output wires to voltage regulator pins (micro USB cable)
Soldering of red wire to both fuse terminals
Carefully check which pins on the voltage regulator correspond to 12V in, GND in, 5V out
and GND out prior to soldering.
To solder the Micro USB cable to the voltage regulator output, you'll need to cut off the
USB A end so you are left with approximately 10cm of cable. Using the wire strippers or a
sharp box cutter/knife, remove the rubber sheath around the wires. If you have a data +
charging cable you should see red, green, white and black wires. The charging only cables
will likely only have the red and black wires. Isolate the red (+5V) and black (GND) wires and
strip approximately 5mm off the end. Solder the red wire to the positive output on the
voltage regulator and black wire to the GND pin. Once you have finished, it should look like
the first panel in the figure below.
NOTE: Soldering can burn you and generates potentially hazardous smoke! Use appropriate
care, fume extractors and PPE to avoid any injury. If you're new to soldering, read through
this guide, which explains in more detail how to perfect your skills and solder safely.
NOTE: When soldering, it's best to cover the exposed terminals with glue lined heat shrink
to reduce the risk of electrical short circuits.
Voltage regulator
Voltage regulator pins
Fuse
Once the two red wires are soldered to the fuse, the fuse can be mounted on the rear panel
of the OWL base. One wire will be connected to the Bulgin plug (next step) and the other to
the Wago 2-way block.
For neater wiring you can also solder jumpers between all the normally open (NO) pins on
the base of the relay board, but this is optional. If you don't solder these connections, make
sure you connect wire using the screw terminals instead. Photos of both are provided
below.Soldered
Screw terminals
The other wires requiring soldering are joins between the buzzer and jumper wires for easy
connection to the GPIO pins and from the LEDs to the power in/jumper wires.
Step 3 - wiring up Bulgin connector
Next we'll need to wire the output relay control and input 12V wires to the Bulgin panel
mount connector. Fortunately all pins are labelled, so follow the wire number table below.
This will need to be repeated for the Bulgin plug as well, which will connect your solenoids
or other devices to the relay control board.
The process is:
1. Connect all wires to Bulgin connector using the screw terminals
2. Mount the connector to the rear panel
3. Leave at least 10cm of wire so it can be connected to the relay board and other
connections later.
Bulgin terminal
numberWire connection
1Blue wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 1
2Green wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 2
3Orange wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 3
4White wire - connects to centre terminal (common) on relay 4
5Red 12VDC - connects to fuse wire already soldered. Make sure
wire is the right length when mounted.
6Black GND - connects to Wago 2-way terminal
NOTE: Skip this step if you're using cable glands.Once all the wires have been connected you can now mount the Bulgin connector to the
OWL base.
Step 4 - mounting the relay control board and voltage regulator
Attach the relay control board to the 3D printed relay control board mount using 2.5 mm
standoffs. Attach the voltage regulator to the 3D printed voltage regulator mount with 2
mm standoffs. The mounted voltage regulator can then be mounted to one corner of the
relay control board. The relay board and voltage regulator can then be installed in the
raised slots in the OWL base.
NOTE: Use 2.5 mm standoffs for mounting the relay control board to its base. Use 2 mm
standoffs to mount the voltage regulator to its base.
Step 5 - wiring the relay control board, voltage regulator, Wago 2-way
blocks and Bulgin connector
Connect the relay control board to the Bulgin connector using the table in step 3 as a
guide.
NOTE: Some relay control boards such as this on Amazon are ACTIVE on LOW. This means
that the signal provided by the Raspberry Pi (a higher voltage) to activate a relay will
instead turn the relay off. While this can be changed in the code, please consider
purchasing HIGH level trigger (e.g the board specified in the parts list) or adjustable trigger
(e.g. this board).Next, connect red and black jumper wires to the VCC and GND header pins on the relay
control board. Now choose one Wago block to be a 12V positive block and the second to
be the negative or ground. To the positive block, connect the 12 V wire from the fuse (12V
input from source), the 12 V input to the voltage regulator, the 12 V solenoid line from the
relay board and the VCC line from the relay board to one of the two WAGO terminal blocks,
twisting the wires together if necessary. Repeat with the second, negative WAGO terminal
block, connecting the input ground line from the Bulgin connector, ground line from the
voltage regulator and the GND black wire from the relay board.

Step 6 - mounting Raspberry Pi and connecting power
Attach the Raspberry Pi to the 3D printed mount using 2.5 mm standoffs. Install in the
raised slots in the OWL base. Connect to micro USB power from the voltage regulator, using
a micro USB to USB-C adaptor. Alternatively, the Raspberry Pi can be powered over the
GPIO, however, this has not yet been implemented.

Step 7 - connecting GPIO pins
Connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO to the relay control board header pins, using the table
below and the wiring diagram above as a guide:The GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi are not clearly labelled, so use this guide to help. Be
careful when connecting these pins as incorrect wiring can shortcircuit/damage your Pi.

Connect one end of the CSI ribbon cable to the camera. We provide a mounting plate that
can be used with both the HQ or V2 cameras, however, we recommend the use of the HQ
camera for improved image clarity. Attach the HQ camera to the 3D printed mount using
2.5 mm standoffs (or 2 mm standoffs if using the V2 camera). Ensuring that the CSI cable
port on the camera is directed towards the Raspberry Pi, mount the camera inside the OWL
case using four M3 standoffs (50 mm long for HQ camera; 20 mm long for V2 camera).
Connect the other end of the CSI cable to the Raspberry Pi CSI camera port.
NOTE the HQ lens comes with a C-CS mount adapter which needs to be removed before
fitting to the camera sensor base. The image won't focus unless the adapter is removed.

The HQ lens will need to be focused, details below, once the software is correctly set up.
Step 9 - adding buzzer and LEDs
Mount the buzzer inside the OWL base using double sided mounting tape and connect the
5 V and ground wires to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins 7 and 9, respectively.
For simplicity we have used two 12V LEDs (which are just normal LEDs with a current
limiting resistor included) for both the 5V TX/GND connection for Raspberry Pi status
indication and also the 12V power connection. While 12 V will work fine on both, the 5 V
connection will be dimmer. If you want to use a non-prepackaged, 3 mm LED for the 5V
connection, you should solder a current limiting resistor to the LED to prevent damage to
either the LED or the Rasperry Pi as described here. Install the 5 V LED inside the OWL base
and connect the 5V and ground wire to GPIO pins 8 (TX pin) and 20 (GND pin), respectively.
Install the 12 V LED inside the OWL base and connect the 12 V and GND wires to their
respective WAGO terminal blocks.

OPTIONAL STEP - adding real time clock module
Although optional, we recommend that you use a real time clock (RTC) module with the
OWL system. This will enable the Raspberry Pi to hold the correct time when disconnected
from power and the internet, and will be useful for debugging errors if they arise. The RTC
uses a CR1220 button cell battery and sits on top of the Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins 1-6.PiRTC module
RTC installed on Raspberry Pi
Step 10 - connecting mounting hardware and OWL cover
There are four 6.5 mm holes on the OWL base for mounting to a boom. Prior to installing
the OWL cover, decide on a mounting solution suitable to your needs. In the photo below,
we used 4 x M6 bolts. The cover of the OWL unit is secured with 4 x M3 nuts and bolts.
Place M3 nuts into the slots in the OWL base. This can be fiddly and we suggest using
tweezers, as shown below. Place the cover onto the base and secure using M3 bolts.

Step 11 - connecting 12V solenoids
Once you have completed the setup, you now have the opportunity to wire up your own
solenoids for spot spraying, targeted tillage, spot flaming or any other targeted weed
control you can dream up. To do this, wire the GND wire of your device (it can be any wire if
it's a solenoid) to the ground pin on the Bulgin plug (the same wire used for the GND from
the 12V power source) and wire the other to one of the blue, green, orange or white wires
on pins 1 - 4. A wiring diagram is provided below. The easiest way to wire them together to
the same GND wire is to create a six-way harness, where one end is connected to the plug,
one of the five other wires to the source power GND and the remaining four to the
solenoids or whatever devices you are driving.Bulgin plug
Ground wiring harness
SBC Options
A single board computer or SBC is the brains behind the OWL. It can do all the image
processing and logic within a single, roughly credit card sized board without moving parts.
These SBCs are the backbone of embedded computing or 'edge computing'. While the
Raspberry Pi is arguably one of the most widely used and well supported SBCs there are
many different options out there. Each has their strengths and weaknesses and may or may
not be good fits with the OWL. We've providing a summary of some SBCs below, but this
isn't an exhaustive list.Currently, only Raspberry Pi 4 and 3B+ work with the OWL and have been tested in full.
Early tests (alpha) have been made with the LibreComputer LePotato. We will update the
'Works with OWL' column as more boards are tested in the community.

Want to help fill in this table? Find one of the untested platforms and give the OWL a go!
NVIDIA has released numerous powerful, embedded computers such as the Jetson Orin
series (and previously the Jetson Xavier NX). These would likely be good options for the
OWL, but are substantially more expensive than the options listed above.
Software
The project will eventually support the use of the two major embedded computing devices,
the Raspberry Pi (models 3B+ and 4) and the Jetson Nano/Jetson Xavier NX for possible
green-on-green detection with deep learning algorithms. At present, just the details on
setting up the Raspberry Pi 3B+/4 are provided below. There are two options for
installation. For the first, all you'll need to do is download the disk image file (vX.X.X-
owl.img) and flash it to an SD card. The second method is more in depth, but takes you
through the entire process from beginning to end. If you're looking to learn about how
everything works, take some time to work through this process.
NOTE In the major update on 17/03/2023 running of the OWL changed from using
greenonbrown.py to owl.py . This ensures better cross compatibility with GoG algorithms.
It improves the modularity of the system.
Quick Method
For this method you'll need access to:
Desktop/laptop computer
Micro SD card reader
Internet with large data capacity and high speed (WARNING: the image file is large and
downloading will take time and use up a substantial quantity of your data allowance if
you have are on a limited plan)Quick method for software installation
Step 1 - download the disk image file
Download the entire disk image file (v1.0.0-owl.img) here: OWL disk image
The latest, stable version will be linked above, however, all other older versions or versions
with features being tested are available here.
Step 2 - flash owl.img to SD card
The easiest way to flash (add the vX.X.X-owl.img file to the SD card so it can boot) the SD
card is to use Balena Etcher or any other card flashing software. Instructions for Balena
Etcher are provided here. Navigate to the website and download the relevant
version/operating system. Install Balena Etcher and fire it up.
Insert the SD card using your SD card reader.
Select Flash from file on the Balena Etcher window and navigate to where you
downloaded the vXX-XX-XX-owl.dmg file. This can be a zip file (compressed) too.
Select the target, the SD card you just inserted.
Click Flash
If this completes successfully, you're ready to move to the next step. If it fails, use Balena
Etcher documentation to diagnose the issue.
Step 3 - power upOnce the SD card is inserted into the slot of the Raspberry Pi, power everything up and wait
for the beep. If you hear the beep, you're ready to go and start focusing the camera.
Step 4 - updating the disk image
The disk image that you downloaded is likely to be a few versions behind the most recent.
We only provide images of the most major updates. So to update the OWL software, just
run the follow these steps.
1. Have the OWL powered on with screen, keyboard and mouse connected. You should
see a desktop with the OWL logo.
2. Press CTRL + ALT + T to open a Terminal window or click the black icon with blue line
and >_ symbol.
3. Once the Terminal window is open, make sure you are working in the owl virtual
environment by running:
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ workon owl
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $
Notice that (owl) now appears before the line in the Terminal window. This indicates you are
in the owl virtual environment. This is critical to make sure you install everything in the
requirements.txt file into the right spot.
4. Once you are in the owl environment, enter these commands on each new line:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd ~
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mv owl owl-old
# this renames the old 'owl' folder to '
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mv OpenWeedLocator owl
# rename the download to 'owl'
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd ~/owl
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ pip install -r requirements.txt
# install
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ chmod a+x owl.py
# changes owl.py to be
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ chmod a+x owl_boot.sh
# changes owl_
Once this is complete your software will be up to date and you can move on to focusing the
camera.
Step 5 - focusing the camera
The final step in the process is to make sure the camera and lens are correctly focused for
the mounting height. To view the live camera feed, we need to stop the process that is
running in the background that would have started when you first turned on the OWL. Enter
the following into the terminal:(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ps -C owl.py
After pressing ENTER, you should receive the following output:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ps -C owl.py
PID TTY
TIME CMD
515 ?
00:00:00 owl.py
The PID is the important part, it's the ID number for the owl.py program. In this case it is
515, but it is likely to be different on your OWL. If the headings PID TTY
TIME
CMD appear but a PID/line for owl.py doesn't appear it could mean two things. Firstly make
sure you've typed owl.py correctly. If it doesn't have the right program to look for, it won't
find it. The other option is that owl.py isn't running, which may also be the case. If you're
certain it's not running in the background, skip the stop program step below, and move
straight to launching owl.py .
If a PID appears, you'll need to stop it operating. To stop the program, enter the following
command:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo kill enter_your_PID_number_here
The program should now be stopped
Now you'll need to launch owl.py manually with the video feed visible. To do this use the
Terminal window and type the following commands:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ~/owl/./owl.py --show-display
This will bring up a video feed you can use to visualise the OWL detector and also use it to
focus the camera. Once you're happy with the focus, press Esc to exit.
OPTIONAL Step 6 - enabling UART for status LED
This is just the cherry on top and non-essential to correct operation of the OWL but to
make sure the status LED you connected earlier blinks correctly the GPIO UART needs to be
enabled.
Open up a terminal console by pressing Ctrl + T . Type:
(owl) pi@owl :-$ sudo nano /boot/config.txtThis will open up the config.txt file. Scroll down to the bottom by holding the down arrow
key and add the following line to the very last line of the file:
enable_uart=1
Press ctrl + x to exit, then type y to save and then enter .
You're now ready to run!
Detailed Method
This setup approach may take a little longer (about 1 hour total) than the quick method, but
you'll be much better trained in the ways of OWL and more prepared for any problem
solving, upgrades or changes in the future. You'll also download and use the latest software
that hasn't been saved in the .img file yet. In the process you'll learn about Python
environments, install Python packages and set it all up to run on startup. To get this working
you'll need access to:
Raspberry Pi
Empty SD Card (SanDisk 32GB SDXC ideally)
Your own computer with SD card reader
Power supply (if not using the OWL unit)
Screen and keyboard
WiFi/Ethernet cable
Detailed OWL installation procedure
Step 1 - Raspberry Pi setup
Before powering up the Raspberry Pi, you'll need to install the Raspian operating system
(just like Windows/MacOSX for laptops) on the new SD card. This is done using the same
process as the quick method used to flash the premade owl.img file, except you'll be doing
it with a completely new and untouched version of Raspbian. To get the Raspberry Pi to the
stage at which we can start installing OWL software, follow these instructions from Adrian
Rosebrock at PyImageSearch. They are very well written, detailed and if you're interested in
computer vision, the rest of the PyImageSearch blog posts are very useful.
NOTE 1: At PyImageSearch Step 3 make sure to create a virtual environment owl (it must
be named owl otherwise the software will not load) instead of cv as written in the guide.
$ mkvirtualenv owl -p python3NOTE 2: At PyImageSearch Step 4 you do not need to compile OpenCV from scratch, the
pip install method (Step 4a) will be a LOT faster and perfectly functional for this project.
Make sure you're in the owl virtual environment for this step by looking for (owl) at the start
of the line, if it's not there type: workon owl
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.5.62
Step 2 - enable camera
We now need to enable the connection to the Raspberry Pi camera. This can be enabled in
raspi-config:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo raspi-config
Select 3 Interface Options, then select P1 Camera. Select Yes to enable the camera. You can
now exit raspi-config and reboot.
Step 3 - downloading the 'owl' repository
Now you should have:
A virtual environment called 'owl'
A working version of OpenCV installed into that environment
a Terminal window open with the 'owl' environment activated. If it is active (owl) will
appear at the start of a new line in the terminal window. If you're unsure, run: workon
owl
The next step is to download the entire OpenWeedLocator repository into your home
directory on the Raspberry Pi.
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd ~
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mv OpenWeedLocator owl
Double check it is there by typing (owl) (owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls and reading
through the results, alternatively open up the Home folder using a mouse. If that was
sucessful, you can now move on to Step 4.
Step 4 - installing the OWL Python dependenciesDependencies are Python packages on which the code relies to function correctly. With a
range of versions and possible comptibility issues, this is the step where issues might come
up. There aren't too many packages, but please make sure each and every module in the
requirements.txt file has been installed correctly. These include:
OpenCV (should already be in 'owl' virtual environment from Step 1)
numpy
imutils
gpiozero
pandas (for data collection only)
glob (for data collection only)
threading, collections, queue, time, os (though these are included as standard Python
modules).
NOTE: Before continuing make sure you are in the owl virtual environment. Check that
(owl) appears at the start of each command line, e.g. (owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ . Run
workon owl if you are unsure. If you are not in the owl environment, you will run into
errors when starting owl.py .
To install all the requirements.txt, simply run:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd ~/owl
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ pip install -r requirements.txt
It's very important that you're in the owl virtual environment for this, so double check that
(owl) appears on the far left of the command line when you type the command in. Check
these have been installed correctly by importing them in Python in the command prompt
and check the package version. To do this:
(owl) pi@owl :-$ python
Python should start up an interactive session; type each of these in and make sure you don't
get any errors.
>>> import cv2
>>> import numpy
>>> import gpiozero
>>> import pandas
Version numbers can be checked with:>>> print(package_name_here.__version__) ## this is a generic example - add the packa
>>> print(cv2.__version__)
If any errors appear, you'll need to go back and check that the modules above have (1)
been installed into the owl virtual environment, (2) that Python was started in the owl
environment, and/or (3) they all installed correctly. Once that is complete, exit Python and
continue with the installation process.
>>> exit()
Step 5 - starting OWL on boot
Now that these dependencies have been installed into the owl virtual environment, it's time
to make sure it runs on startup! The first step is to make the Python file owl.py executable
using the Terminal window.
(owl) (owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ chmod a+x ~/owl/owl.py
After it's been made executable, the file needs to be launched on startup so each time the
Raspberry Pi is powered on, the detection systems starts. The easiest way to do this by
using cron, a scheduler for starting code. So you'll need to add the owl_boot.sh file to the
schedule so that it launches on boot. The owl_boot.sh file is fairly straightforward. It's
what's known as a bash script which is just a text file that contains commands we would
normally enter on the command line in Terminal.
#!/bin/bash
source /home/pi/.bashrc
workon owl
lxterminal
cd /home/pi/owl
./owl.py
In the file, the first two commands launch our owl virtual environment, then lxterminal
creates a virtual terminal environment so outputs are logged. Finally we change directory
cd into the owl folder and run the python program.
To add this to the list of cron jobs, you'll need to edit it as a root user:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo crontab -eSelect 1. /bin/nano editor , which should bring up the crontab file. At the base of the file
add:
@reboot /home/pi/owl/owl_boot.sh
Once you've added that line, you'll just need to save the file and exit. In the nano editor just
press Ctrl + X, then Y and finally press Enter to agree to save and exit.
Finally you just need to make owl_boot.sh executable so it can be run on startup:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ chmod a+x ~/owl/owl_boot.sh
If you get stuck, this guide or this guide both have a bit more detail on cron and some
other methods too.
Step 6 - focusing the camera
The final step in the process is to make sure the camera and lens are correctly focused for
the mounting height. To view the live camera feed, we need to stop the process that is
running in the background that would have started when you first turned on the OWL. Enter
the following into the terminal:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ps -C owl.py
After pressing ENTER, you should receive the following output:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ps -C owl.py
PID TTY
TIME CMD
515 ?
00:00:00 owl.py
The PID is the important part, it's the ID number for the owl.py program. In this case it is
515, but it is likely to be different on your OWL.
To stop the program, you need to enter the following command:
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo kill enter_your_PID_number_here
The program should now be stopped
Now you'll need to launch owl.py manually with the video feed visible. To do this use the
Terminal window and type the following commands:(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ~/owl/./owl.py --show-display
This will bring up a video feed you can use to visualise the OWL detector and also use it to
focus the camera. Once you're happy with the focus, press Esc to exit.
OPTIONAL Step 6 - enabling UART for status LED
This is just the cherry on top and non-essential to correct operation of the OWL but to
make sure the status LED you connected earlier blinks correctly the GPIO UART needs to be
enabled.
Open up a terminal console by pressing Ctrl + T . Type:
(owl) pi@owl :-$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
This will open up the config.txt file. Scroll down to the bottom by holding the down arrow
key and add the following line to the very last line of the file:
enable_uart=1
Press ctrl + x to exit, then type y to save and then enter .
You're now ready to run!
Step 8 - reboot
The moment of truth. Shut the Raspberry Pi down and unplug the power. This is where
you'll need to reconnect the camera and all the GPIO pins/power in the OWL unit if they
have been disconnected. Once everything is connected again (double check the camera
cable is inserted or this won't work), reconnect the power and wait for a beep!
If you hear a beep, grab something green and move it under the camera. If the relays start
clicking and lights come on, congratulations, you've successfully set the OWL up! If not,
check the troubleshooting chart below and see if you can get it fixed.
NOTE The unit does not perform well under office/artificial lighting. The thresholds have
been set for outdoor conditions.
Optional Step - installing RTC and setting the time
The optional real time clock module can be set up by following the [detailed instructions]
(https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-up-and-test-i2c)
provided by Adafruit. This is a quick process that should take less than 10 minutes. Notethat an internet connection is required to set the time initially, however after this the time
will be held on the clock module.
Changing detection settings
Instructions to change detection settings
If you're interested in changing settings there are now two ways to do this: 1. Using
command line flags 2. Opening the owl.py file and changing threshold values
Command line flags
Command line flags are let you specify options on the command line within the Terminal
window. It means you don't have to open up the code and make changes directly. OWL
now supports the use of flags for some parameters. To read a description of all flags

Changing threshold values in owl.py
Other parameters such as selecting or modifying sensitivity settings can be adjusted in the
owl.py file itself.
To edit this file, connect a screen, keyboard and mouse and boot up the OWL. Navigate to
the owl directory and open up greenonbrown.py in an editor. If it's an executable file, it
will ask you if you want to "Execute", "Execute in Terminal" or "Open" (see image below).
Make sure to select the Open option.
Navigate to the owl directory
Open the owl.py file
Once you have opened the file in an editor (this can be a text editor, Thonny, Geany or
other code editors), scroll down to the very bottom and you should come across values you
can change, such as in the image or written out below.Editable values for sensitivity:

Green-on-Green
How to detect in-crop weeds with the OWL
OWL Integration
Green-on-Green capability is here!
Deep learning object detection algorithms for in-crop or 'Green-on-Green' (GoG) require
much more processing power than the green detection algorithms we have used previously.
If we ran these GoG algorithms directly on the Raspberry Pi, the frame rate would be
prohibitively slow. To overcome this, you can use more powerful computers with GPUs (i.e.
any of NVIDIA's Jetson series), alternatively you can connect a third party processor such as
Google Coral's TPU through the USB3.0 ports of the Raspberry Pi 4. This means increased
performance without needing to purchase another embedded computer.
The Google Coral USB accelerator is only $59.99, so it provides performance upgrades
without substantial cost increases. With the added hardware, there are some additional
software installation details that you should follow. And you will need to connect the
Google Coral to the Raspberry Pi USB3.0 port too. At the moment, this won't fit neatly in
the case, but we are continuing to work on improving this.
For all the details on how to install the Google Coral, please head over to the models
directory. We have provided an installation script to make it as straightforward as possible.
Model Training
Effective models need training data, so if you're interested in using the Green-on-Green
functionality, you will need to start collecting and annotating images of relevant weeds for
training. Alternatively, head over to Weed-AI to see if any image data may be relevant for
your purposes.
NOTE There do appear to be some issues with the exporting functionality of YOLOv5/v8 to
.tflite models for use with the Coral. The issue has been raised on the Ultralytics repository
and should hopefully be resolved soon. You can follow the updates here.YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 currently provide the most user friendly methods of training,
optimisation and exporting as .tflite files for use with the Google Coral. There is also a
Weed-AI Google Colab Notebook
Open in Colab
which can be used to train models from
Weed-AI data directly.
Non-Raspberry Pi Installation
Installing OWL software on a non-Raspberry Pi system
Using OWL software on your laptop/desktop or other non-Raspberry Pi system is a great
way to test, develop and learn more about how it works. To start using the software, just
follow the steps below. You will need access to virtual environments and your IDE/editor of
choice. This method has been successfully tested on PyCharm with Anaconda environments.
> git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator
> cd OpenWeedLocator
For the next part, make sure you are in the virtual environment you will be working from. If
you're unsure about virtual environments, read through this PyImageSearch blog on
configuring an Ubuntu environment for deep learning - just skip to the virtual environment
step. FreeCodeCamp has a great blog describing them too.
Assuming the virtual environment is working and is activated, run through these next
couple of steps:
> pip install -r non_rpi_requirements.txt
# this will install all the necessary p
It may take a minute or two for those to complete installing. But once they are done you are
free to run the owl.py software.
> python owl.py --show-display
From there you can change the command line flags (as described above) or play around
with the settings to see how it works.
Image Processing
Image processing details and in-field results
So how does OWL actually detect the weeds and trigger the relay control board? It all starts
by taking in the colour image from the camera using OpenCV and splitting it into itscomponent channels: Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) (RGB) or loading and converting into
the hue, saturation and value (HSV) colourspace. Following that, computer vision algorithms
such as Excess Green `ExG = 2 * G - R - B` or thresholding type approaches on the HSV
colourspace can be used to differentiate green locations from the background.
Once the green locations are identified and a binary (purely black/white) mask generated, a
contouring process is run to outline each detection. If the detection pixel area is greater
than the minimum area set in minArea=10 , the central pixel coordinates of that area are
related to an activation zone. That zone is connected to a specific GPIO pin on the
Raspberry Pi, itself connected to a specific channel on the relay (one of IN1-4). When the
GPIO pin is driven high (activated) the relay switches and connects the solenoid for example
to 12V and activates the solenoid. It's all summarised below.Results
The performance of each algorithm on 7 different day/night fields is outlined below. The
boxplot shows the range, interquartile range and median performance for each algorithm.
Whilst there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) for the recall (how many weeds were
detected of all weeds present) and precision (how many detections were actually weeds),
trends indicated the ExHSV algorithm was less sensitive (fewer false detections) and more
precise, but did miss more smaller/discoloured weeds compared to ExG.
The image below gives a better indication of the types of weeds that were detected/missed
by the ExHSV algorithm. Large, green weeds were consistently found, but small discoloured
or grasses with thin leaves that blurred into the background were missed. Faster shutter
speed would help improve this performance.3D Printing
3D printing instructions and files
There are seven total items that need printing for the complete OWL unit. All items with
links to the STL files are listed below. There are two options for OWL base:
1. Single connector (Bulgin) panel mount
Pros: of this method are easy/quick attach/detach from whatever you have
connected, more water resistant.
Cons: more connections to make, more expensive
2. Cable gland
Pros: fewer connections to make, cheaper, faster to build.
Cons: more difficult to remove, more water resistant.We also provide a link to the 3D models on Tinkercad, an online and free 3D modelling
software package, allowing for further customisation to cater for individual user needs.

Updating OWL
Updating OWL software
We and others will be continually contributing to and improving OWL as we become aware
of issues or opportunities to increase detection performance. Once you have a functioning
setup the process to update is simple. First, you'll need to connect a screen, keyboard and
mouse to the OWL unit and boot it up. Navigate to the existing owl directory in /home/owl/
and either delete or rename that folder. Remember if you've made any of your own changes
to the parameters/code, write them down. Then open up a Terminal window (Ctrl + T) and
follow these steps:
IMPORTANT: Before continuing make sure you are in the owl virtual environment. Check
that (owl) appears at the start of each command line, e.g. (owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ .
Run workon owl if you are unsure. If you are not in the owl environment, you will run into
errors when starting owl.py .
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd ~
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mv owl owl-old
# this renames the old 'owl' folder to '
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mv OpenWeedLocator owl
# rename the download to 'owl'
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd ~/owl
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ pip install -r requirements.txt(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ chmod a+x owl.py
(owl) pi@raspberrypi:~/owl $ chmod a+x owl_boot.sh
And that's it! You're good to go with the latest software.
If you have multiple units running, the most efficient method is to update one and then
copy the SD card disk image to every other unit. Follow these instructions here. ADD
